I just finished watching Dr. Ronny Kohavi's "Ultimate Guide to A/B Testing" ["Ultimate Guide to A/B Testing"](https://youtu.be/hEzpiDuYFoE?si=lwkaiIYRqocL2F7B). This was a lengthy presention made enjoyable by his enthusiasm and wealth of practical experience. I wanted to share some thoughts on the statistical practices he touches on during his presentation. Indeed, Dr. Kohavi's discussion of p-values, an essential tool in Null Hypothesis Testing  and a potentially consequential decision support mechanism, highlights some critical limitations of frequentist statistics in A/B testing.

1. P-value Misinterpretation:
    
The p-value is often described as the probability of observing data as extreme or more extreme, given the null hypothesis is true. This is a subtle but crucial point. It's a conditional probability related to the data, not the hypothesis itself.This leads to several issues:
  * Sampling vs. Inference: P-values provide a sampling probability, not an inference probability. We're interested in the probability that our hypothesis is true, given the data, not the other way around. This is not conducive to drawing definitive conclusions about whether variant A or B is truly better.
  * P-hacking Vulnerability: The reliance on p-values can encourage "p-hacking", where researchers manipulate data or analyses to achieve statistical significance, leading to unreliable results at best.
  * Common Misconception: As Dr. Kohavi correctly notes, many people mistakenly interpret (1-p) as the chance the alternative hypothesis is true. This misunderstanding is widespread and problematic.


2. The Importance of Priors:

Dr. Kohavi touches on the concept of a "Prior" in a nod to Bayes' theorem as a way to get a probabilistic statement about the null hypothesis. However, he states, "we don't know the prior." This, I believe, is where a crucial point is missed. In fact, the Prior is what we do know before seeing the data. It's the embodiment of our existing knowledge or lack thereof, assumptions, beliefs about the situation at hand, lays these bare for all to see and critique. This  is the power of Bayesian analysis  – a framework that allows us to incorporate that prior knowledge into our analysis, rather than ignoring it. This leads to greater understanding of the data, and crucially, allows us to quantify the probability of variant B being better than variant A, and the magnitude of that difference.

Essentially by using bayesian statistics we can answer the question "what is the probability that B is better than A?" rather than the frequentist question of "what is the probability of the observed (or more extreme) given that A and B are the same?". Finally it renders unnecessary the dependence on an arbitrary significance level of 0.05 that hails from the obscurantism of the early 20th century.
In essence, while A/B testing based on frequentist methods has been widely used, it's essential to recognize its limitations. The frequentist approach, with its reliance on p-values, can lead to misinterpretations and unreliable conclusionn, and has led to considerable damage in the social, political, judicial, and now with the awareness raised on the crisis of replication, scientific arenas. 

Especially in today's data-driven world, the Bayesian approach provides a more robust and informative alternative. Yes, it demands more effort, but its consistent framework stands in stark contrast to the hodgepodge of case-dependent recipes inherent in traditional statistics, a complexity that often proves difficult even for classically trained statisticians.

I would love to hear thoughts and experiences with A/B testing and statistical methods! Feel free to reach out if you'd like to dive deeper into these concepts or need help with your data.
