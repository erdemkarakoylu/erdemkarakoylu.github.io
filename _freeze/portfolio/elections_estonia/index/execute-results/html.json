Explores how demographic variables predict party preference and leverages the ZeroSumNormal distribution to address identifiability.\n:::\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis portfolio project models voting preferences in Estonia using demographic data and a Bayesian categorical likelihood. The goal is not just to predict voter behavior, but to **extract interpretable insights** about how education, nationality, age, and gender influence party preference.\n\nWe leverage PyMC and the `ZeroSumNormal` prior to address overparameterization, a common challenge in categorical regression. The Bayesian framework allows us to work directly with **posterior distributions**, giving a probabilistic handle on model uncertainty and demographic effects.\n\n## Data Overview\n\nThe dataset comes from [SALK](https://salk.ee/), the Liberal Citizen Foundation in Estonia. It contains individual-level voting data annotated with demographics. Each row represents one voter, and the columns include:\n\n- **Demographics**: age group, gender, education, nationality  \n- **Geography**: electoral district and unit  \n- **Party choices**: 11 binary columns (one per party) marking vote intent\n\nWe renamed ambiguous columns for clarity (e.g., \"Hard to say\" → \"Undecided\") and excluded geography from modeling to focus strictly on demographics.\n\n## Exploratory Analysis\n\nBefore modeling, we explore how voting preferences differ across demographic groups. Below are two representative plots.\n\n### Party Preference by Nationality\n\nEstonians and non-Estonians (predominantly ethnic Russians) show clear divergences:\n\n- **Estonians** tend to favor Reformierakond and EKRE.  \n- **Non-Estonians** show higher preference for Keskerakond and \"Mitte ükski erakond\" (\"None of the above\").\n\n*Figure: Distribution of party choices by nationality.*\n\n",
