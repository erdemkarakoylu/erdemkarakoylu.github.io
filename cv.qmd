## Experience & Research Highlights

**Freelance Data Scientist – Marine Remote Sensing and Ecological Forecasting**  
*Bayesian modeling and machine learning for environmental data*

- Developed Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) and hierarchical models to estimate marine optical properties and chlorophyll concentrations from satellite radiance data.
- Built predictive XGBoost models to infer phytoplankton community structure, outperforming baseline approaches.
- Used probabilistic ODE parameter estimation to analyze nonlinear dynamics in marine ecological systems.
- Published reproducible Bayesian modeling workflows as open-source Jupyter notebooks for environmental science.

**Data Scientist – Research Innovations Inc. (Alexandria, VA)**  
*DOD and DOJ-focused machine learning and NLP systems*

- Contributed to the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that improved information retrieval for military planners.
- Led Bayesian A/B testing to optimize system components and refine model selection for production environments.
- Built and iteratively refined an active-learning image classification pipeline to reduce manual annotation requirements.
- Supported targeted sentiment analysis using fine-tuned large language models for sensitive domains.

**Machine Learning Researcher – NASA Goddard Ocean Biology Processing Group / SAIC**  
*Earth observation and probabilistic modeling for ocean color remote sensing*

- Developed Bayesian models to predict satellite-derived ocean color products, improving chlorophyll and particulate property estimates.
- Conducted Monte Carlo simulations to quantify uncertainty and error propagation in remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) data.
- Created climate data visualizations and analysis pipelines supporting scientific reports and satellite mission deliverables.
- Advocated for probabilistic approaches and led internal discussions on Bayesian methods for biogeophysical modeling.

**Researcher – UC San Diego / Scripps Institution of Oceanography**  
*Thesis: Foraging Sorties Hypothesis – Inferring Behavioral Rhythms in Marine Primary Consumers*

- Adapted a planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) imaging system to quantify real-time feeding states in individual marine zooplankton.
- Captured high-resolution time series of gut pigment dynamics to infer behavioral state transitions (feeding, digestion, resting).
- Built an individual-based model linking physiological state to vertical foraging behavior under environmental constraints.
- Calibrated imaging measurements against chemical extraction to ensure accuracy and repeatability across individuals.
- Findings published in *Limnology and Oceanography Methods* (2009); follow-up research on temperature effects published in *Journal of Plankton Research* (2012), where a gut fluorescence image was featured on the journal cover.
