Bayesian categorical regression on Estonian voter data using PyMC. Explores how demographic variables predict party preference and leverages the ZeroSumNormal distribution to address identifiability.

## Introduction

This portfolio project models voting preferences in Estonia using demographic data and a Bayesian categorical likelihood. The goal is not just to predict voter behavior, but to **extract interpretable insights** about how education, nationality, age, and gender influence party preference.

We leverage PyMC and the `ZeroSumNormal` prior to address overparameterization, a common challenge in categorical regression. The Bayesian framework allows us to work directly with **posterior distributions**, giving a probabilistic handle on model uncertainty and demographic effects.

## Data Overview

The dataset comes from [SALK](https://salk.ee/), the Liberal Citizen Foundation in Estonia. It contains individual-level voting data annotated with demographics. Each row represents one voter, and the columns include:

- **Demographics**: age group, gender, education, nationality  
- **Geography**: electoral district and unit  
- **Party choices**: 11 binary columns (one per party) marking vote intent

We renamed ambiguous columns for clarity (e.g., "Hard to say" → "Undecided") and excluded geography from modeling to focus strictly on demographics.

## Exploratory Analysis

Before modeling, we explore how voting preferences differ across demographic groups. Below are two representative plots.

### Party Preference by Nationality

Estonians and non-Estonians (predominantly ethnic Russians) show clear divergences:

- **Estonians** tend to favor Reformierakond and EKRE.  
- **Non-Estonians** show higher preference for Keskerakond and "Mitte ükski erakond" ("None of the above").
