> “Bayesian methods make better use of uncertainty — so why not make them easier to explore?”

This post introduces a lightweight, interactive dashboard for **Bayesian A/B testing** built with Streamlit and ArviZ. It’s designed to help you experiment faster, think probabilistically, and get clear answers — without writing formulas or wrangling with p-values.

## 🧠 Why Bayesian?

A quick refresher: in contrast to the frequentist approach, Bayesian A/B testing gives us the **full distribution** of possible outcomes. It lets us:

- Compute `P(B > A)` directly
- Visualize the magnitude and uncertainty of effects
- Incorporate prior beliefs
- Define a **ROPE**: a practical threshold for saying “this difference doesn’t matter”

## 🛠️ App Features

Here’s what the app supports:

- **Data input**: sample, upload, or manual
- **Group mapping**: assign any group labels to A and B
- **Flexible priors**: control the beta distribution for both arms
- **HDI control**: choose your desired confidence level
- **ROPE region**: set a tolerance range for negligible effects
- **Cumulative updates**: simulate sequential testing
- **Session restart**: start fresh anytime
